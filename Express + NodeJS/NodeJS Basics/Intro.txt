Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

-> Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web pages.
-> Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which provides it with its speed and performance. Node.js is also highly scalable, making it a good choice for high-traffic applications.
-> Node.js is used by many popular companies, including Netflix, PayPal, and Uber. It is also a popular choice for developing microservices, which are small, self-contained services that can be combined to create larger applications.

Here are some of the key features of Node.js:
-> Cross-platform: Node.js can run on Windows, Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.
-> Open source: Node.js is open source software, which means that it is free to use and distribute.
-> JavaScript: Node.js uses JavaScript, which is a popular and widely used programming language.
-> Asynchronous I/O: Node.js uses asynchronous I/O, which makes it very efficient and scalable.
-> Event-driven: Node.js is event-driven, which makes it very responsive and easy to use.

Difference between nodejs and browser JavaScript
    Browser                     Node.js

    windows                     No window
    DOM                         NO DOM
    Interactive Apps            server side Apps
    no filesystem               file systems
    fragmentation               versions
    ES6 Modules                 commonJS
